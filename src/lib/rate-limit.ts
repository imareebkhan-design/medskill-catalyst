/**
 * Brute-force guard for the shared admin passcode.
 *
 * Two counters, and a caller is refused if either one trips:
 *
 *  - An in-process counter. Always available and free, but each serverless
 *    instance keeps its own, so on its own it only bounds what a single
 *    instance will accept.
 *  - A Postgres counter, shared by every instance.
 *
 * Both exist deliberately. The passcode-gated API routes (careers admin,
 * invoices) read from Supabase over HTTP and never touch Postgres, so they keep
 * serving real applicant and invoice data through a Postgres outage. A
 * Postgres-only limiter that failed open would leave precisely those endpoints
 * unguarded at precisely that moment; the in-process counter still holds there.
 *
 * Postgres is touched ONLY when a passcode is rejected. An accepted request
 * costs nothing: it would otherwise pay a cross-region round trip (~300ms, see
 * src/lib/db.ts) on every call to routes that have no other reason to reach the
 * database, and couple their latency and availability to it. Recording a
 * failure and learning the resulting count is one statement, so the guard never
 * costs more than one query, and only on the unhappy path.
 *
 * Cross-instance abuse is still caught: every failure increments the shared
 * counter and reads back the global total, so an attacker who spreads guesses
 * across instances is refused on the first failure that crosses the limit
 * wherever it lands, not after the limit on each instance separately.
 *
 * The Postgres layer fails OPEN on error. Locking every admin out because the
 * database is unreachable would be a self-inflicted outage — the same mistake
 * as reporting a database failure as a bad passcode — and the in-process
 * counter still applies while it is down.
 *
 * The window is fixed, not sliding: a caller who exhausts one window can start
 * again the moment the next one opens. That is the accepted trade for a counter
 * that is cheap to reason about and cheap to store.
