# Credential system: deployment checklist

Nothing below has been done to production. Each item marked **[GATE]** needs your approval.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Where | Value / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CREDENTIAL_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Production | `https://medskillscatalyst.com` (required; issuance refuses to run without it on production) |
| `CREDENTIAL_EMAIL_MODE` | Production | `off` until the first real issuance, then `live` **[GATE]**. `live` is ignored on non-production deployments. |
| `CREDENTIAL_EMAIL_MODE=redirect` + `CREDENTIAL_EMAIL_REDIRECT_TO` | Preview | Sends every credential email to a QA inbox instead of the learner |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | all | Already used by the site |
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | all | Already set. PDFs go to a new **private** bucket `credentials`, created on first use; the app refuses to use it if it's public. |
| `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` | all | Already set |
| `ADMIN_AUTH_MODE`, Clerk keys, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` | see AUTH_ROLLOUT.md | **[GATE]** |
| `CREDENTIAL_STORAGE`, `DEV_AUTH_ENABLE` | never on Vercel | Local development only; both are refused on Vercel |

## Database migration

`prisma/migrations/20260925120000_credentials/migration.sql` is **additive only**: a new
enum value (`ISSUER`), four nullable/defaulted columns on `courses`, six new tables,
indexes, triggers and RLS. Nothing is dropped or rewritten, and the migration is safe to
re-run (tested twice in a row).

1. Take a Supabase backup (Dashboard → Database → Backups), or confirm PITR is on.
2. `npx prisma migrate deploy` with `DIRECT_URL` pointing at production **[GATE]**.
3. Check: `select count(*) from credentials;` returns 0, and
   `select relrowsecurity from pg_class where relname='credentials';` returns `t`.

## Before the first real credential

1. **Program codes:** Admin → Credentials → Programs. Set codes for the real programs.
   The dev seed used FND/ADV, but the final codes are your decision.
2. **Approved artwork:** upload it as a new template version (Templates → Upload). Tick
   "production", preview it, then activate. The development template can't issue on
   production.
3. **Sending domain:** confirm SPF, DKIM and DMARC for `medskillscatalyst.com` in Resend
   (Domains page shows "Verified") **[GATE: DNS]**.
4. **www → apex:** set `www.medskillscatalyst.com` to redirect to
   `medskillscatalyst.com` in Vercel → Domains **[GATE: DNS/domain]**. I deliberately
   didn't add a code-level redirect, because it would loop if Vercel already redirects
   the other way.
5. **Rate limiting:** add a Vercel Firewall rule, e.g. 60 req/min per IP on `/verify/*`
   and `/api/verify/*`, in front of the app-level limiter.
6. Upgrade `next` to the latest 15.x patch (`npm audit` reports a critical advisory
   against the installed 15.5.19). This is pre-existing and not caused by this work.

## Production smoke test (after deploy) [GATE]

1. With an individual admin login, issue one credential to an internal email (email mode
   `off`) and open its detail page.
2. Scan the QR on the PDF with a phone and confirm it opens the verification page, not
   signed in.
3. Enter the certificate ID at `/verify` in lower case and confirm it lands on the same page.
4. Check `curl -sI https://medskillscatalyst.com/verify` shows `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.
5. Revoke it and confirm the page shows **Revoked** with no reason, and the PDF link returns 404.
6. Switch email to `live`, issue to a staff inbox and check it arrives with SPF/DKIM pass.

## Rollback

- Code: redeploy the previous deployment. The new tables are simply unused.
- Auth: unset `ADMIN_AUTH_MODE`.
- Email: set `CREDENTIAL_EMAIL_MODE=off`.
- Data: credentials are never deleted. Revoke any issued in error.
